# eMedical-Certificates
<h3><em>A concept of developing an alternative solution, to existing medical certificate recording keeping systems, using blockchain technology.</em></h3>
<p>Healthcare documents today are shared across multiple organizations to have a complete medical history of a patient.
<br>As a result, it is very crucial that this sort of data not be mishandled due to the nature of sensitivity and the consequences an error could potentially cost. Unfortunately, the curren systems can be prone to human error, mishandles and even prone to being attacked.
<br> A blockchain based alternative could solve a lot of the flaws of modern day existing systems and this is a basic model of what a system of the sort would look like.
